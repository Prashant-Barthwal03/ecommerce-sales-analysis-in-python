# ecommerce-sales-analysis-in-python
E-commerce data analysis using Python involves extracting, cleaning, analyzing, and visualizing data to gain insights into sales, customer behavior, and product performance
The e-commerce sales analysis focuses on understanding sales and profit trends across different categories and subcategories. Using groupby operations in Python, the data was aggregated to compute:

Total Sales and Profit by Category
Total Sales and Profit by Subcategory
To visualize the results:

Line Chart: Shows the trend of sales and profit over time, helping identify seasonal patterns and fluctuations.
Pie Chart: Displays the proportion of sales and profit by category, highlighting the most and least profitable product categories.
Bar Chart: Compares sales and profit across subcategories, allowing for deeper insights into which products perform best.
These visualizations help in identifying high-revenue and high-profit categories, optimizing product strategies, and making data-driven business decisions
